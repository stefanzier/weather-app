# Node Weather
Node terminal application to get the current weather statistics

Simple to use...

**Search** using the `address` argument
```zsh
node app.js --adress="123 Cherry Lane"

123 Cherry Ln, Medford, NY 11763, USA
It's currently 34.56
It feels like 29.86
```

Or use the `-a` argument to alias `address`
```zsh
node app.js -a "123 Cherry Lane"

123 Cherry Ln, Medford, NY 11763, USA
It's currently 34.56
It feels like 29.86
```
